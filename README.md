# Raspberry_NTAG
Python3 code example for I2C NTAG

This example deals with I2C communication and os daemon interaction so that it is hardware and os dependent.
It is tested on Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian Jessie OS. The Wifi daemon is wpa_supplicant. You can find more
about wpa_supplicant from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wpa_supplicant
